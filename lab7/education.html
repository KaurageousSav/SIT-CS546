      <h2>Muffin School of Dog Training</h2>
      <p>My fav class in this school was the dog walking class. I was taught to walk and often times run with dogs without stepping into their harness and hurting myself.</p>
      <aside>One time I was jogging with the master Dog Muffin, along with a couple of other unleasehed dogs. Somehow Muffin started running and I statrted jogging with her and since I hadnt been to the dog walking lecture before this, I ended up at the hospital.</aside>

    <h2>Snuffy School of Dog Mastery</h2>
    <p>My favorite class in this school was the dog's med class, where we were assigned to feed a dog with the medicine the dog doesnt like.</p>
    <aside>My favorite memory of this school is that whenever we pupils played BAdminton and our Shuttlecock fell on the ground, Snuffy used to get hold of the Shuttlecock and run away with it.</aside>
